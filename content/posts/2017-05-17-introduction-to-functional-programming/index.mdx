There is been quite hype around functional programming and its advantage, and its even known as an alternative to object oriented programming.
We all have heard about various functional languages such as OCaml, Clojure, Haskell, and many languages such as Python, JavaScript, Scala provide functional programming techniques.

## What is Functional Programming ?

As the name suggests **functions as considered first-class objects**.
Being first-class objects means that functions will be treated as objects in these languages.
Functions can be dynamically built, stored in a variable and can even be passed around as parameters.
This simply means functions are center of concern here rather than focusing on objects like in object-oriented programming.
Functions talked here is directly derived from concepts of functions in mathematics.
However these functions are different from typical method functions in imperative programming.

## Functional programming vs Object-oriented programming

It’s important to compare these programming ways to identify the differences and identify correct usage of functional programming.
Primary concern of functional programming is not ‘ how do do it ’ but rather ‘ what to do ’.
Major difference could be identified as using declarative programming model in functional programming rather than it’s competitor’s imperative programming model.

There are some more difference such as using maps over loops as well as unimportance of execution order.
Some of these differences will be discussed in following content.

## Basic functional programming concepts

**Pure functions** are used mainly in functional programming. Simply these functions are **without side effects**.
Simply a function would take some input, process them as needed and return intended result. These pure functions consist of following properties to ensure their purity.

**Immutable data** structures are used in functional programming. Immutable data can not be modified and initially set values are final.
As an example if we declare variable as **`int x = 10`** , it wouldn't be changed with **`x = 12`**.
So you would have to create new data structures instead of modifying existing ones.

Functions are **stateless**, meaning that functions should be depended on any external state or should not update any external states.
If the function is not depended on any state, it will run identically for same input values.
This means that it should always perform the task as if the first time. As this would not update any external states there wouldn’t be any side events because of this function.
Let’s first consider following imperative code block:

```javascript
int x = 2
function incrementOne(){
   x++
} 

print(x)
```

If we run **`incrementOne()`** we can see that would result in **`3`**. However if we run **`incrementOne()`** again, it would result in **`4`**.
We can clearly see that the function **`incrementOne()`** is clearly dependent on some external state ( **`x`** as of here) and is not a pure function.

Let’s design above code from functional programming prospective:

```javascript
int x = 2
function incrementOne(int i){
   return i++
}

print(incrementOne(x))
```

Here **`incrementOne(2)`** would result in **`3`** regardless of the number of times we run the function.
Another fact to pay attention is that we are printing out **`incrementOne(x)`** and not **`x`**.
Its because **`x`** is immutable and isn’t possible to change from value **`2`**, and have to use new data structure like **`int y = incrementOne(x)`**.



# H1

It is recommended to NOT use H1s as it is reserved for the article heading. Any H1 is set as an H2.

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

## Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
